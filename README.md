Indexed Capitalization


Given a string and an array of integers representing indices, capitalize all letters at the given indices.

For example:

capitalize("abcdef",[1,2,5]) = "aBCdeF"
capitalize("abcdef",[1,2,5,100]) = "aBCdeF". There is no index 100.
The input will be a lowercase string with no spaces and an array of digits.

Good luck!
